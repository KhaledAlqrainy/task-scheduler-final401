## Task Scheduler:

* Summary of idea:  this web application acts as a personal assistant, the user should be able to either add reminders, or to select from a list of tasks that can also be 
scheduled.

* Pain points:
  1. with a lot of task organizing our goal become difficult.
  2. Some tasks are preferred to be automated.
  3. Sometimes the lack of organization can lead to missing  more important tasks at expense of the less important tasks.
  4. Sometimes users spend a lot of time on tasks that can be done with one command or click.
  5. Sometimes users are drawn between opening many apps at the same time.
  6. Sometimes user need to login to multiple web pages, this project help him to asign derectly to these web pages.

* Minimum viable product:

  1. The user should type some kind of a memo and set the time when the assistant should remind the user about.
  2. The user should be able to select from a number of tasks the assistant offers like opening the browser and opening a list of pages so the work place is ready for them when 
     they come.
  3. The user is expected to receive notifications about upcoming tasks.
  4. If the assistant notices that the user is actually using the device near the time of the task, 
     it will not just open everything and interrupt the user's workflow, but instead, it will show him a notification that some task is about to take place.
  <!--5. send notification on email +  -->
